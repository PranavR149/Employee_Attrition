# Project Description
The Employee Attrition Prediction project utilizes advanced machine learning models such as XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to address the critical need for predicting employee turnover. By leveraging the IBM HR Analytics Dataset, this project employs meticulous preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key attrition factors. Feature selection and binary classification facilitate accurate model training.

Used recall as the main metric by fixing the precision and XGBoost model achieved higher recall value of 77%, effectively identifying at-risk employees. Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved a decent recall value of 70%.

Business Case Study (Why Recall?):
The project includes a detailed business case study showing that losing an employee costs about $50,000, while effective retention strategies cost approximately $15,000 per employee. By optimizing the precision threshold at 30%, the model ensures cost-effective retention, balancing costs with turnover reduction.

This project demonstrates machine learning's capability in attrition prediction and contributes to improving workforce stability and organizational performance through data-driven insights.
